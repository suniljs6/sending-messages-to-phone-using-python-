SENDING-MESSAGES-TO-MOBILE-USING-PYTHON
--
  Send sms via a terminal. Uses python and way2sms.

  The following code can be easily used to send sms for free via way2sms. The advantage here is that the code when compiled using python asks message and number to be sent to and automatically sends the message. No need to login and click again and again.

  To run this code you need to have an way2sms account which gives an id and user-password you can use those id and password to send messages to mobile with help of my programm.
